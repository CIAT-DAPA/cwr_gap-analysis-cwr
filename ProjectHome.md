# Gap Analysis #

The crop wild relative (CWR) gap analysis is a GIS-based methodology that enables the identification of CWR taxa that are not currently sufficiently conserved in genebanks, as well as specific geographic regions targeted for further collecting of populations of these CWR taxa.

The methodology uses species presence data and environmental (typically climatic, although soils and other data can be incorporated depending on data availability) data as inputs. Species potential distributions models (SDMs) are created based upon these inputs using the Maxent methodology.

Here is our project website displaying results of the gap analyses:
