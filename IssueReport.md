# How to report issues? #

If you want to report **an issue** on the database, the website or the scripts and/or R packages that we're developing, please as much as possible sending us an email (of course you can do), but we really prefer to keep this portal organized at the extent possible and hence we suggest you to use it for reporting issues, improvements, lacking features.

**Scientific questions**, on the other hand, should be addressed to our emails.

To report an issue, you need to go to this project's issue tab here:

**http://code.google.com/p/gap-analysis-cwr/issues/list**

There you will find a list of pending issues. If you click in the **"New issue"** button, on the right left of the page, you will go a form, in which you can select a template:

  1. Defect report from user
  1. Defect report from developer
  1. Review request

Unless you are a tester or a developer you will use the **Defect report from user**, you then need to provide a summary (one-line, please), and a more complete description of the problem or bug you found. You can then attach a file such an screenshot or a figure that has, for instance, a missing area or so.

**Don't worry about any other fields in this form**, and just **click** on **_"Submit issue"_**.

Thanks for helping us improving our tool.
