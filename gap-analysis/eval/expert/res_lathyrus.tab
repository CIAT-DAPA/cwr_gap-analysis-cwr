There are definitely more species to be included which are entirely not covered by any current sampling. This is based on recent phylogenetic study.	"From point for phylogenetic relationship to L. sativus at least following species should be considered:
Lathyrus blepharicarpus, Lathyrus amphicarpos, Lathyrus setifolius"	Neutral	Agree	Agree	Agree	Agree	There might be more L. sativus in germplasm collections, although it is hard to assess their representativeness and overlap.
