Colin as I indicated to you earlier by email I can intelligently comment only on the first list so am placing NA in the second and these lists. As well, I indicated that the taxonomy you use here mostly matches that I accept, but that there are some minor changes. I placed NA in the few species in the first list that I consider synonyms of other species.

Sincerely, David Spooner."
