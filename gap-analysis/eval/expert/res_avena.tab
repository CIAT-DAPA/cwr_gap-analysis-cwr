Avena brevis important
Avena hispanica, importnat but probably synonym with A. strigosa
Avena canariensis"	Landraces of A. sativa subsp. nudisativa from China deserve greatest attention.	Disagree	Agree	Agree	Agree	Agree	Agree	Agree	Disagree	Disagree	Agree	Agree	Agree	Agree	Disagree	Agree	Although you say your ananalysis is about crop wild relatives, you include cultivated taxa, such as A. abyssinica, A. byzantina and A. hybrida. These taxa are extremenly important to collect if landraces are still available. In contrast, you do not mention the cultivated taxa A. brevis, A. nuda and A. hispanica, which would be as important. All landraces of A, sativa including the hull-less form, A. sativa susbsp. nudisativa from China, should have greatest relevance. Some of the taxa you include are questionable as species, as they may be singled out by the taxonomy you use as a reference, while other classifications consider them as subtaxa of other species, e.g. A. atheranta (belongs to  A. sterilis), A. hybrida (belongs to A. fatua or A. sativa), A. occidentalis (belongs to A. fatua) and A. trichophylla (belongs to A. sterilis). We have not yet a consistent taxonomy of the genus and communication is very challenging.	Axel Diederichsen	Research Scientist, Curator	Plant Gene Resources of Canada	axel.diederichsen@agr.gc.ca

A. murphyi, A.magna (correct name for A.maroccana), and A.insularis share a tetraploid genome, which is closer to A.sativa compared to A.barbata (incl. Avena barbata subsp. atheranta). They also share interesting quality traits with high seed weight. A. insularis is quite recently detected and needs further exploration. A.strigosa is a marginally cultivated species with very interesting quality characteristics (ß-glucan, antioxidants) and exceptional tolerance to abiotic stresses (Machair corn in the Hebrids). As diploid species it is an important resource for genotyping the oat genepool. A.macrostachya is an exceptional species, as it is perennial. It could be a source for perennialty and winter hardiness. A.fatua and A.sterilis are primary genepool species. There are rich collections already available. A.occidentalis is a subspecies of A.fatua. Taxonomic and subspecific categories deserve more attention to identify additional gaps. There is lack of taxonomic expertise.	"Several very important diploid species in the Avena genepool are missing in the above list:
A.damascena (1,1), A. atlantica (2,3), A. hirtula (1,1) and A. wiestii (1,1) have been repeatedly demonstrated to have exceptionally high ß-glucan contents. A.eriantha (1,1) has extraordinarily low husk content. Endemic species are A.canariensis (Canaries), A.damascena (Syria, Morocco). A.longiglumis Dur. (2,1) proved to be a genetic intermediate, which facilitates crossing tetraploids with cultivated oats, which would not be possible otherwise. A.ventricosa (2,3)."

Avena atherantha could have probably been found as A. barbata subsp. atheranta. Generally there is a tendency to neglect subspecific taxonomy, because to be a skilled taxonomist is not very rewarding in current scientific world. Other A.barbata accessions may represent A.atherantha. Taxonomic situation with A.byzantina is likewise unclear. Only few genebanks separate it from A.sativa. Found samples are probably underestimations. The same with A.occidentalis, A.hybrida, A.trichophylla and A.fatua. In a primary genepool species like A.fatua, which is quite well represented in collections, population criteria (traits of interest) need to be considered. 
There are accessions of A.macrostachya in European genebanks (e.g. IHAR), but they are very few and highest priority is fully justified. A.magna (maroccana) is very interesting from a use perspective. It has been domesticated by G.Ladizinsky and has a potential similar to tetraploid (Durum) wheat. Thus it deserves by far more attention. This applies even more for A.murphyi, which is highly threatened in its natural habitat."
