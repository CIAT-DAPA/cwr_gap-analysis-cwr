Wild counterparts of cultivate species of P. coccineus, P. lunatus, and P. vulgaris in my opinion have been well-collected. This is not the case for wild P. dumosus. P. augusti and P. pachyrrhizoides, are also well collected, although I am not sure as how their habitat is conserved. The others wild species need more collecting efforts from our part; eventhough Phaseolus persistentus proved to be not related to P. vulgaris (see Delgado-Salinas 2006). 	"Phaseolus acutifolius
